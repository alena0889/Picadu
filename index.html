          <h2 class="post-title">Introducing Myself</h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            Let me introduce myself. I’m Anna Cheston. I was born on the 29th of March 1985 in Minsk under the
            zodiac sign of Aries. I believe that stars influence our fate and character. They say that Aries is full of
            energy, a leader, straight talker, ambitious and frank, likes sport, stubborn, hot- tempered, but quick to
            apologize. Actually, I’m persistent. It is different, I think.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            As for my appearance, I’m rather tall and slim. I have never thought I am a beauty. I wish I were more
            beautiful. I think that I’m even-tempered, rather reserved, calm and modest. But sometimes I can lose my
            temper and become either angry or sad. I like staying alone and sometimes I retire into my shell. But at the
            same time I like my friends, I like to laugh and to joke. I have got a sense of humour. It means I
            understand humour and appreciate it. But unfortunately, I’m not often witty myself. I think, I am able to
            «keep my head when all about me are losing theirs» and to stand up to difficulties when things are not going
            my way. Besides, I am sincere and tolerant, friendly and faithful, hard-working and serious.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            There are many things in our life which I like and some I dislike. I like when everything is OK. Being happy
            is one way of being wise. I like to study, because knowledge is useful . I am fond of reading as it gives
            not only knowledge but also wonderful moments of joy and pleasure. Sometimes I enjoy watching TV or
            listening to the radio. Especially when I can hear some wonderful pieces of music. I like music. It makes
            people better. It awakens the best feelings and high emotions. But there is a thing that makes me crazy. I’m
            fond of horses and equestrian skill. I dislike overcrowded buses. And I hate getting up early. I’m happy I
            have got more things I like than I dislike.

          <h2 class="post-title">About Myself and My Family</h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            Allow me to introduce myself to you. My name is Neaky Drew, I was born in Bryansk on the 20th of April 1993.
            My
            hobbies and interests vary greatly. I enjoy spending time and relaxing with my true close friends as much as
            gardening. Volleyball and cooking, keeping in good physical shape and reading, studying and dreaming are all
            very interesting to me. The most thrilling and never boring of all for me is English. My dream is to
            understand any single word and even the most difficult expressions from English movies or English- speaking
            people. And I really do my best to make this dream come true.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            My family is large by modern standards: Mom, Dad, my little sister and I. My mother is in her early 40es. I
            must say she looks young for her age. I like her deep brown eyes, her soft voice and the way she smiles. My
            mother is patient and warm-hearted.
            I have got some hobbies. I’m always very busy but when I’m free I like to read books. I think books help me
            to continue my education. In my opinion, books are a source of new and useful information. I enjoy reading
            books about life of famous people, but I hate reading detectives. I think it’s just a waste of time. I also
            love music. My favorite types of music are dance music, hip-hop and rock. I like to draw. I study at art
            school and take lessons of painting there.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            I admire my father for his strong character. There are moments in the life when one feels
            lost and nothing is left but a deep sigh. I’m happy that I can cast all my troubles and concerns to my Mom
            and Dad. They understand and can easily comfort me. It is my parents who give me a good and right example to
            follow. I feel safe: the little world within my family is perfect. The things I hope to achieve in life: to
            have a very successful career, a healthy and interesting life, to
            build the country home of my dreams and to find someone perfect in life to share all that great things with.
